## HubbardMPS
This directory contains a Julia project for the tensor network calculations of one-dimensional Hubbard models. A version of the code base under active development can be found in the repository [HubbardTN](https://github.com/DaanVrancken/HubbardTN).

## PySCF_calculations
This directory contains the code used for downfolding the materials trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene.

## VASP_calculations
This directory contains the VASP input files for the structure optimizations, hybrid functional calculations for trans-polyacetylene, and the downfolding procedure of Sr<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>3</sub>. In the calculations, version 6.4.2 has been used.
